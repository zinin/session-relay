# Lines like `  * grok-4.6 (default)` and `  - kimi-k3`, and ONLY the ones under the
# `Available models:` header. Two reasons for the anchor, both load-bearing:
#
#   * A bullet on its own is not a model. `grok models` can exit 0 while printing bulleted
#     prose — `Error: not logged in` followed by `  - run \`grok login\`` yields the slug
#     `run` without it — and HOST_MODELS is what the interactive native page is built from
#     (commands/mesh-review.md Step 2.3, "for each chunk of 4 entries from HOST_MODELS"),
#     so a bogus slug becomes a selectable reviewer and then a rejected spawn_subagent model:.
#   * An output shape this does not recognise yields NOTHING, which is the fail-closed side:
#     an empty HOST_MODELS is exactly the input `native_degraded` is written for, and that
#     path SAYS "native не запущен; остальные работают" out loud. Inventing slugs from an
#     unrecognised format has no such indicator.
#
# The header is in the captured fixture and in live output. `Default model: grok-4.6` sits
# above it and has no bullet, so it was already excluded; the anchor now excludes it twice.

# The list ENDS at the first line after the header that is not a bullet — a blank line, a
# `Notes:` header, prose. The range used to run to end-of-file, so any bulleted section printed
# after the list (`Notes:` / `  - see docs`) became slugs `see`, `docs`… — the same bogus-reviewer
# hole the header anchor closes on the way in, left open on the way out. The captured listing
# is contiguous (test-list-host-models.sh pins the count), so stopping at the first non-bullet
# line loses nothing.
